# Hardware Accelerators On FPGA

# Architectures:

- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessing performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and maximum frequency, along with resource utilization, during the design phase.
- **Hardware Architectures:** Designing arithmetic operators like adders, Booth multipliers (base 2/4/8), and dividers.
- **Architectural Optimization Strategies:** Implementing strategies to optimize architecture for better performance.
- **Iterative, Parallel, Pipeline Architectures:** Exploring different architectural paradigms for efficient computation.
- **Resource Sharing:** Efficiently allocating and sharing resources within the architecture.
- **Parallelism:** Leveraging parallel processing for improved performance.
- **Local Frequency Modification:** Implementing local frequency adjustments (acceleration/slowdown) using a PLL.
  
## FPGA Implementation:

- **VHDL:** Utilizing VHDL for describing digital systems including array types and variables.
- **Synthesis:** Analyzing optimizations performed by synthesis tools.
- **STA (Static Timing Analysis):** Managing timing constraints, clock domain changes, and performance evaluation at various frequencies.
  
## Skills:

- **Optimization Criteria Formalization:** Defining optimization criteria based on project requirements.
- **Complex Digital System Design:** Developing optimized hardware architectures considering specific criteria such as latency, throughput, frequency, resources, and power consumption.
- **Implementation:** Translating designs into VHDL, orchestrating FPGA flows effectively (Xilinx or Intel-Altera), and meticulously analyzing implementation results.
